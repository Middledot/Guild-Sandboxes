# Guild Sandbox Bot
This is a bot you can use to create sandbox servers on discord to test bots or library changes.<br>
I personally use this for testing welcome messages on my bot cuz it's 2000 lines of code I can't just not test it.

Inspired from [nextcord/vcokltfre's NextBox](https://github.com/vcokltfre/nextbox)<br>
twist is that it's made in [pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) hehe


Yes this breaks when restarting because it doesn't use a database, and I might change that eventually. Otherwise works cool
